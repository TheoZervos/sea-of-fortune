# Pirates: Sea of Fortune

---

## An Overview of Sea of Fortune

**Sea of Fortune** is a top-down pirate-themed PvP/PvE adventure game where players sail the seven seas in search of islands to explore. Up to 4 players can join a world and engage in thrilling adventures.

- **Max Players:** 4 per world
- **Note:** While the game’s theme centers on the "seven seas," there will not be seven distinct oceans.

### Key Features:
- Players will find procedurally generated dungeons on islands filled with enemies and treasures.
- Players spawn on a home island, and as they explore further, better loot can be found, but at the risk of tougher enemies.
- Random enemy spawns, such as the **Kraken**, await players during their journeys.

### Treasure & Upgrades
The treasure found in dungeons can be used to purchase items and upgrades via the shop system.

#### Shop Items:
- **Weapons**
- **Armor**
- **Ship Upgrades:**
  - Increase ship’s speed, durability, and control.

- Defeat enemies, or
- Hoard wealth like a true pirate! **ARRG!!**

## Advanced Topics

### Networked Multiplayer
**Sea of Fortune** will feature fully functional networked multiplayer, supporting up to 4 players in one world. Players can interact through in game and explore the vast oceans and islands the world has to offer. Players will communicate to one another through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking, forgoing the need for a central server.

Each island may spawn a procedurally generated dungeon. Inside, players will encounter:
- Random treasures,
- Enemies, and more!'
- Wavefunction Collapse Algorithm to generate the terrain/layout inside the dungeons.

## Midterm Goals

By midterms, we plan to have:
- A default base map of **1000x1000 grid spaces**.

- Multiplayer PvE combat.
- Four overworld random events and enemy encounters (Kraken, Ghost Ship, Whirlpool, Special Dungeon).
- Fully functional shop/upgrade system (3 armor upgrades, 3 weapon upgrades, 12 ship upgrades).
- Overworld map generation fully finished (1000x1000 grid)
