## An Overview of Sea of Fortune

**Sea of Fortune** is a top-down pirate-themed PvP/PvE adventure game where players sail the seven seas in search of islands to explore. Up to 4 players can join a world and engage in thrilling adventures.

- Players spawn on a home island, and as they explore further, better loot can be found, but at the risk of tougher enemies.
- Random enemy spawns, such as the **Kraken**, await players during their journeys.

### Treasure & Upgrades
The treasure found in dungeons can be used to purchase items and upgrades via the shop system.
