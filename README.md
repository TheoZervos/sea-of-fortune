## An Overview of Sea of Fortune

**Sea of Fortune** is a top-down pirate-themed PvP/PvE adventure game where players sail the seven seas in search of islands to explore. Up to 4 players can join a world and engage in thrilling adventures.

- **Max Players:** 4 per world
- **Note:** While the game’s theme centers on the "seven seas," there will not be seven distinct oceans.

### Key Features:
- Players will find procedurally generated dungeons on islands filled with enemies and treasures.
- Players spawn on a home island, and as they explore further, better loot can be found, but at the risk of tougher enemies.
- Random enemy spawns, such as the **Kraken**, await players during their journeys.
- Player vs. Player (PvP) interactions: Players may encounter each other in the world, and what happens next is entirely up to them!

### Treasure & Upgrades
The treasure found in dungeons can be used to purchase items and upgrades via the shop system.

#### Shop Items:
- **Weapons**
- **Armor**
- **Ship Upgrades:**
  - Increase ship’s speed, durability, and control.
